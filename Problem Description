916. Word Subsets
LEVEL: Medium
You are given two string arrays words1 and words2.
A string b is a subset of string a if every letter in b occurs in a including multiplicity.
For example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior" but is not a subset of "world".
A string a from words1 is universal if for every string b in words2, b is a subset of a.
Return an array of all the universal strings in words1. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["e","o"]
Output: ["facebook","google","leetcode"]

Example 2:
Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["lc","eo"]
Output: ["leetcode"]

Example 3:
Input: words1 = ["acaac","cccbb","aacbb","caacc","bcbbb"], words2 = ["c","cc","b"]
Output: ["cccbb"]
